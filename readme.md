# **FFmpeg Tools**  
### A collection of tools I used frequently enough to bundle into a single .py file  
  
## Add Subs  
Provide the script with a video file and a subtitle file and it will mux them  
  
## DTS to AC3  
Transcodes the audio track on the given video file to a 640kbps AC3  
  
## Transcode to HQ H264  
Transcodes the input to an HQ H264 (crf 15) with 380kbps AAC audio  
  
## Transcode to H265  
Transcodes the input to an H265 (crf 26) with 380kbps AAC audio  
  
## Transcode to H265 and scale  
Transcodes the input to an H265 (crf 26) with 380kbps AAC audio  
Will also ask for a new resolution width and scales the output accordingly
